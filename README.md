# abacus-practice

Generate abacus practice sheets with hidden answers.

## Goals

- Support multiplication, addition, subtraction.
- Support toggling of carrying.
- Support history, difficulty control, scoring.
- React cell, column, table.
- Google fonts.
- Webpack + hot module replacement.
- Use CSS Grid.
- Use AWS Lambda function to generate sheet data. Unnecessary over engineering, but good for practice.
